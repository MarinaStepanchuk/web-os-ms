start a project: npm run start

An account with administrator privileges:
username: admin
password: 1111


The application is written in pure Java Script. Time taken - 1 month.

The application has the basic functionality of the operating system:
- desktop
- a set of basic applications: file manager, applications for opening images, audio and video files, notepad.
 - applications can be started from the panel or by dragging the required file into the opened application.
 - files can be opened both individually and as a group by selecting an area
- there are 2 context menus: general and file menu
- through the context menu you can see the data of files and folders and assign access rights for them, load, open, delete, rename, copy and cut files and folders, reflect and hide hidden files.
- administrator has rights to create users and restrict access rights to all files, a new user by default is created a desktop, a folder with configured access rights in the users directory and a set of applications
- when trying to access a protected file, an error is displayed
- all applications can be freely moved around the desktop by pulling the top bar, minimized and put into full screen mode.
- You can create text files using Notepad, as well as edit previously created files.

For more realism, I recommend to bring the browser in full-screen mode :)
